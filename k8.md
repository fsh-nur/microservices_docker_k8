## Deploying nginx using K8

1. Create a YAML file within your directory

```
nano nginx-deploy.yml
```

2. Input the following script within your YAML file

```
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment

kind: Deployment # what kind of service/object do you want to create?

# what would you like to call it - name the service/object


metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector: 
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 3

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: <enter name of image e.g fshei/node-app>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

3. Run the deploy file
