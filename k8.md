## How does Kubernetes (K8) work

K8 is a container orchestration platform that manages the deployment , scaling. and management of containerized applications. Kubernetes has a luster architecture which coinsists of multiple nodes ( a master node and worker nodes). The master node would manage and orchestrate the cluster, and the worker nodes would execute the containers. A pod in K8 represents one or more containers that are tightly coupled and share the same resources. K8 also provides services as a way to connect and expose applications which are running in pods, as well as provide support for the scaling of pods and services.

## Benefits of K8

- High Availablity, Scalablity:
  Enables the automatic scaling of applications and applications are distributed among multiple nodes, automatically rescheduling or replacing failed containers

- Container Orchestration:
  Simplifies the deployment and managementt of containerized applications. It can automate load balancing, and container scheduling
  
- Rolling Update:
  Ensures the seamless transition of new instances when updating old ones without downtime

- Extensibility:
  Wide range of plugins, extensions and integrations available, allowing you to integrate with oother tools
  
 - Declarative approach:
   You can define the desired state of your applications in configuration files such as `.yml`


## Who is using K8

Google, Microsoft and Netflix are among some of the many companies which use K8. It was originally created by Google, and is used to manage its expansive infrastructure. Microsoft also uses Kubernetes internally to manage and power their various services. Netflix relies on K8 for managing its containerized applications and microservices architecture. They have developed and contributed to various K8-related tools also.

## When NOT to use K8

- If there is an application that is not large-scale as K8 is built for apllications to be run on multiple servers and broken down into these microservices
- Do not have the budget: K8 needs high maintenance and cost to upkeep 

## Deploying nginx using K8

1. Create a YAML file within your directory

```
nano nginx-deploy.yml
```

2. Input the following script within your YAML file

```
apiVersion: apps/v1 # which api to use for deployment

kind: Deployment # what kind of service/object do you want to create?

# what would you like to call it - name the service/object


metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  selector: 
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  replicas: 3

  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    
    spec: 
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: <enter name of image e.g fshei/node-app>
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

3. Run the deploy file 

```
kubectl create -f nginx-service.yml
```

4. Check if the service is running

```
ubectl get service
```
